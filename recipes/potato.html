        <h1>Potatoes: God's Mistake?</h1>
          <img src="img/potato.jpg" alt="delicious and possibly evil mashed potatoes in three varieties, one sweet potato and two classic russet, served in two plates with melted butter on top and lovely artisanal spoons posed nearby">
        <h2>When will someone think of the children???</h2>
          <p>Everyone thinks that potatoes are just so lovely. That they're the backbone of many delicious recipes. That they are a wonderful source of easy calories for very, very cheap. And these aren't wrong. But. BUT.</p>
          <p>But isn't it just <em>all too suspicious</em> that these ground apples just showed up one day? Aren't we going to talk about the real truth here? The truth that <strong>aliens brought them here</strong>. I'm tired of being silenced by the Potato Illuminati!</p>
          <p>But until that day, please enjoy this recipe for delicious mashed potatoes, suitable for vegans.</p>
