        <h1>Potatoes: God's Mistake?</h1>

        <h2>When will someone think of the children???</h2>
          <p>Everyone thinks that potatoes are just so lovely. That they're the backbone of many delicious recipes. That they are a wonderful source of easy calories for very, very cheap. And these aren't wrong. But. BUT.</p>
          <p>But isn't it just <em>all too suspicious</em> that these ground apples just showed up one day? Aren't we going to talk about the real truth here? The truth that <strong>aliens brought them here</strong>. I'm tired of being silenced by the Potato Illuminati!</p>
          <p>But until that day, please enjoy this recipe for delicious mashed potatoes, suitable for vegans.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>2.5 lbs russet potatos, peeled and cut into 1 1/2 inch chunks</li>
              <li>1/3 C whole unroasted cashews. (If you don't have a high speed blender, no worries, just boil them for 20 minutes beforehand or soak overnight and drain.)</li>
              <li>1/2 C veggie broth at room temperature</li>
              <li>1/3 C refined coconut oil at room temperature</li>
              <li>3/4 tsp salt</li>
              <li>Lots of fresh black pepper - though as in the case of the <a href="../recipes/orzilla.html">Orzilla</a>, the stale stuff in the pantry works fine as well</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
          <ol>
              <li>Place potatoes in a pot and submerge in cold water by about an inch. Sprinkle in two teaspoons of salt. Cover and bring to a low boil.</li>
              <li>Place cashews in a high-speed blender with vegetable broth and blend until completely smooth, scraping the sides of the food processor with a spatula occasionally to get everything.</li>
              <li>When potatoes are boiling, lower heat to a simmer, uncover and cook for about 12 minutes, until fork tender. Drain potatoes, and place back in the pot.</li>
              <li>Mash with a potato masher, to break the potatoes up a bit. Add half of cashew mixture, coconut oil, salt and pepper and mash with a potato masher until relatively smooth and no big chunks are left.</li>
              <li>Add the remaining cashew mixture, mix it in, and use a hand blender on high speed to whip them. They should become very smooth, fluffy and creamy. Taste for salt and pepper along the way, transfer to a serving bowl, and serve!</li>
          </ol>
