      <h1>Cursed Pancakes</h1>
        <img src="./img/pancake.jpg" alt="A gorgeous abomination of a sweet and savory pancake">
        <p><em>This may look like a normal pancake...but it's so much more complicated than that...</em></p>
      <h2>Do you think that God stays in heaven out of fear of what he has created?</h2>
        <p>There I was - my back to the wall, my eyes fixed with the hellish red pits of the hell beast. My sword was heavy on my back, digging into the sharp rings of my chain mail. I had to chance to win this battle, I thought, and panicked.</p>
        <p>But then I had a vision. A vision so vast and profound that it haunts me even still. In the sky above us appeared a beautiful pancake, filled with all the favorites of my youthful indulgences - sausages, oatmeal, sweet syrup. I knew I had to survive this fight to turn this into a reality.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, please enjoy this healthy breakfast recipe.</p>
