      <h1>Cursed Pancakes</h1>
        <img src="./img/pancake.jpg" alt="A gorgeous abomination of a sweet and savory pancake">
        <p><em>This may look like a normal pancake...but it's so much more complicated than that...</em></p>
      <h2>Do you think that God stays in heaven out of fear of what he has created?</h2>
        <p>There I was - my back to the wall, my eyes fixed with the hellish red pits of the hell beast. My sword was heavy on my back, digging into the sharp rings of my chain mail. I had to chance to win this battle, I thought, and panicked.</p>
        <p>But then I had a vision. A vision so vast and profound that it haunts me even still. In the sky above us appeared a beautiful pancake, filled with all the favorites of my youthful indulgences - sausages, oatmeal, sweet syrup. I knew I had to survive this fight to turn this into a reality.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, please enjoy this not very healthy, but yes very delicious breakfast recipe.</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>7 oz veggie sausage</li>
            <li>1 1/4 C AP flour</li>
            <li>1/2 C quick cooking rolled oats</li>
            <li>2 1/4 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 C unsweetened non-dairy milk</li>
            <li>1/4 C unsweetened applesauce</li>
            <li>1 Tb safflower oil (or any other mild vegetable oil)</li>
            <li>1 Tb sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>plus refined coconut oil for cooking</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a non-stick pan over medium heat, cook the sausages in a little oil. Once cooked, set them aside to cool completely. When they are cool enough to handle, tear them into tiny pieces. No need to wash the pan, you will be using it for pancakes in a bit and the sausage oil will taste good! Pop them in the freezer to cool completely while you make the pancake batter.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, oats, baking powder and salt in a mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and add milk, applesauce, oil, sugar and vanilla.</li>
            <li>Use a rubber spatula to stir the wet a bit to combine, then incorporate it with the dry, mixing just until everything is moistened.</li>
            <li>Fold cool, crumbled sausages into the batter. Let batter rest 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat pan over medium heat. Melt coconut oil for each pancake. Scoop a scant 1/2 cup into the pan and cook until bubbly, then cover with a lid for another minute or two so it cooks through. Flip and cook on the other side till lightly brown. Proceed with the rest of the pancakes!</li>
            <li>When serving, sprinkle with flake sea salt after pouring the syrup if you love sweet and salty. I also threw on some maple butter, yum.</li>
        </ol>
